  <p> SociaLoc is a website that allows you to know who nearby would like to meet with you! It can also show what events are happening around you such as any big sales or big parties when other people decide to post about them! This is all about you getting involved with other people, but offline. You find each other here, and then you can meet each other in real life! </p>
